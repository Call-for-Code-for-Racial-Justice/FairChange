## 5. Next Steps

**Where next? And wireframes:**

The code contained within this Git Repository is essentially a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The team focused on getting the base functionality of being able to capture location details, timestamps, incident descriptions and video. Furthermore the incidents can be viewed in the map view and videos can also be accessed either via the COS instance or the web site.

As with any project of this nature, we also have a list of future enhancements which could form part of future sprints and / or through an open source mechanism. Some examples include:

- Voice activation for logging and recording an incident via the mobile application (hands free is deemed to be safer in various scenarios such as driving).

- Advanced search features for clustering incidents based on location and timestamp for example in order to help form "evidence packages" consisting of multiple submissions to the platform.

- Advanced analytics (Video analytics, audio & speech to text, Natural Language Understanding models and techniques such as entity extraction). This would help automatically gather more information on the incidents captured and over time could feed into machine learning models to help understand escalation patterns and education / reform models.

- Over time, if real-time video streaming was made available, along with feeds from other sources (e.g. scanners, social media feeds), it may be possible to create intervention procedures especially if the platform is linked to police systems.

**Additional use case scenarios**

The diagrams below represent some of the additional scenarios which could be built into the mobile application and back-end.
