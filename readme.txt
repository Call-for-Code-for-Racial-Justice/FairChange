Call for Code - Police & Judicial Reform and Accountability 

From traffic stops and arrests to sentencing and parole decisions, use technology to better analyse real-world data, provide insights and make recommendations that will drive racial equality and reform across criminal justice and public safety. 

This solution addresses 2 hills related to the problem statement above:

The public will have access to factual data on police behavioural infractions so that police officers can be held publicly accountable for their actions.
Law enforcement agencies have access to free technology which identifies both singular incidents and behavioural patterns so that regular data-driven evaluations of policing outcomes take place.
At the heart of the solution resides an intelligent visualisation system, based around a map view which makes it easy for users to find single or grouped incidents. In order to facilitate the capture of incidents, a mobile application will also be created with the ability to recognise and react to different circumstances (e.g. stop and search, car stops etc). Over time API's could be developed in order to capture data from additional sources such as existing mobile applications and social media.

In order to process the information captured, we will investigate the use of AI (video analytics, speech to text, natural language understanding, sentiment analysis, tone analysis and visual recognition).

The Vision.
